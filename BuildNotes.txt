For this build of the game, I've fixed the camera system, changed the enemy AI to sorta flock to the player,
added sounds, added a new bar for the super, added a main menu screen, credits screen, and controls screen.
The player now gains mana and super points for killing enemies, and enemies will respawn randomly in one of
the spawnpoints.
Not happyat all with how this turned out, cause is over ambitious game idea and very poor time management.
